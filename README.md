Make sure you've created an app-ads.txt file using the spec provided by IAB Tech Lab.
Copy and paste the following code snippet into your app-ads.txt file:

Publish your app-ads.txt on the root of your developer website (for example, sampledomain.com/app-ads.txt).
Make sure the domain is entered exactly as listed on Google Play or the App Store.

Crawl your app-ads.txt file to verify your app. We'll do a few checks to make sure the app-ads.txt is found and formatted correctly. This typically takes a few moments, but sometimes takes longer.
